Description: 
    Create class, which provides functionality connected with movie description.
    The main idea is to enable user to set and get description of the movie, using an object, which is an instance of this class.
    We'd like to have a possibility to support some kind of short and long version of description.
    Please also add some file like e.g "example_main.py", which will show functionalities of the new created class and will be used for testing.
    Example usage (pseudocode):
    """
    * Create new object *
    >>> Add short description: Father meets his son after many years of separation.
    >>> Add long description: After many years of separation, father meets his son on the desert island.
    >>> Object was correctly created
    * Get information *
    >>> Description of the move:
    >>> Short: Father meets his son after many years of separation.
    >>> Long: After many years of separation, father meets his son on the desert island.
