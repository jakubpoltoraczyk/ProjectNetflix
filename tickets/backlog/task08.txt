Title: Create main function of program: ProjectNetflix

Description: 
    At first create some kind of movies list and then prepare operations related to this list.
    You should implement most of available functionalities, but you don't have to implement everything - it's your decision.
    Also don't worry if something will go wrong, at the beginning it's difficult to create such big program.
    Please don't contain reading and writing to files - that will be the last part of our `terminal` version of this program.
    One tip from me: I suggest to use many functions instead of one, so don't do something like this:
    ```
    def main():
        movies = [Movie(...), Movie(...), ...]
        while True:
            option = None

            # block with choosing option
            
            if option == 1:
                # block with adding new movie
            if option == 2:
                # block with removing movie
            if option == 3:
                # block with changing information about movie

            # and so on
    ```
    I suggest to do something like this instead:
    ```
    def main()
        movies = [Movie(...), Movie(...), ...]
        while True:
            option = get_option()
        
        if option == 1:
            add_new_movie()
        if option == 2:
            remove_movie()
        if option == 3:
            change_movie_information()
        
        # and so on
    ```
    So separate main function into many smaller functions and these smaller functions into smaller ones again etc. 
    Trust me, that's will be more transparent and also you will be able to fix bugs faster.
