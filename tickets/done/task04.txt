Title: Refactor Person base class to use dates

Description: 
    So recently we added new Date and DateUtils classes, which provide some functionality related to dates.
    Currently we store in Person class `age` variable.
    Please remove it and add two new variables: date_of_birth and date_of_death (obviously find a way how to consult if someone is alive or not).
    Important! Refactor means that functionality of the class in general shouldn't be changed, only improved (e.g. using new Date class and methods from 
    DateUtils instead of creating age variable), but of course you can add some methods like get_date_of_birth etc.
