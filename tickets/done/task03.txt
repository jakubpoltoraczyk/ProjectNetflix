Description: 
    Create class, which will represents person (or in other words: basic personal information).
    What's really important, remember that this class will be a base class of next classes: Actor and Director.
    So please think what are common elements from both ot these jobs/people and contain them in new created class.
    Add few methods, with which ones we can get easily access to members of instance of this class, maybe if you'd like to you can also add
    some kind of protection e.g. user shouldn't be able to set empty personal name (in the reality everybody has a name).
    Also add examplemain.py file, which will be a demonstration of this new created class.
